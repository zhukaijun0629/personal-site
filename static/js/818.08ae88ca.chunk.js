After graduation, I became a structural / software engineer at [Saiful Bouquet](https://www.saifulbouquet.com/) and [Walter P Moore](https://www.walterpmoore.com/) prior to joining [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).\n<br />\n<br />\nAs a software developer, I love building innovative and intuitive applications that bring essential values to the customers and are fun to play with. I also enjoy developing software to improve efficiency and productivity, and to resolve practical problems. \n<br />\n<br />\nAs a former structural engineer, I have designed Hospitals, Airports, Colleges, Parking Garages, Pedestrian Bridges that made of steel and/or reinforced concrete. It is a special feeling to be in the field and witness my design come to life.\n<br />\n<br />\nWhen I was a railroad reseracher at UIUC, I performed researches to eliminate cracks within bolted rail joints by establishing a parametric study of static and dynamic finite element simulations and fatigue analysis, thus improve railroad safety. I have published 3 journal articles (2 out of 3 as first author) and 2 conference papers (1 out of 2 as first author), and made presentations and poster sessions at multiple conferences.\n\n# Publications [(Google Scholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n5HBwzgAAAAJ&hl=en)\n***Journal Articles***\n<br />\n- Yin, H., Qian, Y., Edwards, J.R. and **Zhu, K.** (2018) Investigation of relationship between train speed and bolted rail joint fatigue life using finite element analysis. *Transportation Research Record*, 2672(10), pp.85-95.\n\n- **Zhu, K.**, Qian, Y., Edwards, J.R. and Andrawes, B.O.
