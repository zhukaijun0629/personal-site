I received my M.S degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I was a [Graduate Research Assistant](https://railtec.illinois.edu/member/kaijun-zhu/)and was advised by [Dr. Riley Edward](https://railtec.illinois.edu/member/j-riley-edwards/) and [Prof. Yu Qian](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/qian_yu.php). After graduation, I became a structural / software engineer at [Saiful Bouquet](https://www.saifulbouquet.com/) and [Walter P Moore](https://www.walterpmoore.com/).\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a 2-year-experienced software developer, I love building applications that are intuitive and fun to play with. I also enjoy developing software to improve efficiency and productivity, and to resolve practical problems. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a 5-year-experienced structural engineer, I have designed Hospitals, Airports, Colleges, Parking Garages, Pedestrian Bridges that made of steel and/or reinforced concrete. It is a special feeling to be in the field and see them constructed.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a former railroad reseracher at UIUC, I performed researches to eliminate cracks within bolted rail joints by establishing a parametric study of static and dynamic finite element simulations and fatigue analysis, thus improve railroad safety. I have published 3 journal articles (2 out of 3 as first author) and 2 conference papers (1 out of 2 as first author), and made presentations and poster sessions at multiple conferences.\r\n\r\n# Publications [(Google Scholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n5HBwzgAAAAJ&hl=en)\r\n***Journal Articles***\r\n<br />\r\n- Yin, H., Qian, Y., Edwards, J.R. and **Zhu, K.** (2018) Investigation of relationship between train speed and bolted rail joint fatigue life using finite element analysis. *Transportation Research Record*, 2672(10), pp.85-95.\r\n\r\n- **Zhu, K.**, Qian, Y., Edwards, J.R. and Andrawes, B.O.
